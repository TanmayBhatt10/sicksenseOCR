Clinical Significance
The normal serum creatinine reference interval does not necessarily reflect a normal GFR for a patient. Because mild and 
moderate kidney injury is poorly inferred from serum creatinine alone. Thus, it is recommended for clinical laboratories to routinely 
estimate glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), a “gold standard” measurement for assessment of renal function, and report the value 
when serum creatinine is measured for patients 18 and older, when appropriate and feasible. It cannot be measured easily in 
clinical practice, instead, GFR is estimated from equations using serum creatinine, age, race and sex. This provides easy to 
interpret information for the doctor and patient on the degree of renal impairment since it approximately equates to the 
percentage of kidney function remaining. Application of CKD-EPI equation together with the other diagnostic tools in renal 
medicine will further improve the detection and management of patients with CKD.
